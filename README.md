### Objective
This repository stores the Web Services and Applications module coursework as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) program at ATU College. I began the Data Representation module last year, which covered similar lectures. This is why I initially created this repository in 2023 and have continued working on it since January 2024. 

### Assignments
The Assignments section of this directory is designated for the course-related assignments "Assigment03-cso.py" and "assignment04-github.py," corresponding to modules 3 and 4 of this course.

### Files
The Files section is where the CSV files used in the exercises are located.

### Labs
Each week includes a Lab or Laboratory exercise where we practice the content covered during that week. In this section, I am storing the labs from modules 1 to 10.

### Final Project
As a conclusion to this module, we were tasked with developing a program showcasing our comprehension of creating and utilizing RESTful APIs. This is the section where my final project is stored.
