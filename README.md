### Objective
This repository stores the Web Services and Applications module coursework as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) program at ATU College. I began the Data Representation module last year, which covered similar lectures. This is why I initially created this repository in 2023 and have continued working on it since January 2024. 

### Assignments
The Assignments section of this directory is designated for the course-related assignments "Assigment03-cso.py" and "assignment04-github.py," corresponding to modules 3 and 4 of this course.

#### Assignment 3: 
Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json". Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py" This program should not be a long one I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way It should be about 10ish lines long.

#### Assignment 4: 
Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository, The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name. The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository (You will need authorisation to do this). I do not need to see your keys (see lab2, to follow) Handup: Push the program as assignment04-github.py to assignments repository. Marks: Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.


### Files
The Files section is where the CSV files used in the exercises are located.

### Labs
Each week includes a Lab or Laboratory exercise where we practice the content covered during that week. In this section, I am storing the labs from modules 1 to 10.

### Final Project
As a conclusion to this module, we were tasked with developing a program showcasing our comprehension of creating and utilizing RESTful APIs. This is the section where my final project is stored.
